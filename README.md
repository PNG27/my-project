Simon Game
Overview
The Simon Game is a memory-based game where the user has to repeat a sequence of colors that is generated randomly. With each correct sequence, the level increases, and the sequence becomes longer. The goal of the game is to achieve the highest score possible.

The user must repeat the sequence by clicking the corresponding colored buttons.
As the game progresses, the sequence gets longer and more challenging.
The user’s highest score is tracked and displayed.
Sound effects for level-up, game-over, and celebration.
Visual effects for both the game sequence and user input.
Responsive to keyboard and mouse inputs.
How to Play
Press any key to start the game.
